Hi!

I made this example using:
node: v7.7.2

To install dependencies please run
npm install

Then please set up a mongodb pointing to the data directory before you start
mongod --dbpath /data

To start the app use
npm start

Then load a web browser at
http://localhost:3000/


NOTES:

* I made it so it checks de provided URL and loads the data on startup,
so the first time you load the site it already has articles

* This version includes the functionality,
I'll be adding bootstrap and some stylish work next!


UPDATE 09/09

I finally added bootstrap!
It's looking pretty close to the example imo

I also replaced the setInterval function with a cronjob using node-schedule
it now runs at every hour when the minute is 5

Following FluxaÌ€ advice, I added a bit of structure to the project
could still be better, but it's a lot cleaner now

routes/index will load both web and api routes
and every pages.jade should have it's very own private.js to add functionality

config/db it's looking pretty weak, it's my very first time using mongodb
but I'm eager to learn
