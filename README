Hi!

I made this example using:
node: v7.7.2

To install dependencies please run
npm install

Then please set up a mongodb to the data directory before you start
mongod --dbpath /data

To start the app use
npm start

Then load a web browser at
http://localhost:3000/


NOTES:

* I made it so it checks de provided URL and loads the data on startup,
so the first time you load the site it already has articles
(app.js:91 > checkAPI();)

* This version includes the functionality,
I'll be adding bootstrap and some stylish work next!
